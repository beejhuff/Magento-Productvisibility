Intention
=========

It is a common case: You create a product in the backend of Magento and want it
to be shown in the shop. But in a little bit of hurry you miss to set a property
which prevents its visibility.

That's why this module exists. Its intention is to show you, which properties
could be responsible for hiding the product. It is ready to handle multiple
stores and so it gives you the chance to determine in which store the product
should_ be visible.

.. _should: Extensibility_

You'll find the output of this module as a new tab of the
product edit page in the backend of Magento.

Netresearch_Productvisibility has `not a finished state`_, so much work has to
be done to improve it.

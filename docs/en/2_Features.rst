Features
========

We provide a set of default checkpoints which include

- if product is enabled
- if product is visible in catalog
- if product has a website
- if product has a category
- if product is in stock
- if product is up to date in price index
- if product is up to date in stock index

For configurable products a warning will be shown additionally, if its simple
products are visible individually.

If a checkpoint fails, there will be a howto which gives you a hint.
For some checkpoints there will be also a description where to find the product
in the shop (categories, websites).

These checkpoints are exclusively visible after you selected a store view. Otherwise
there will appear a list of store views with the information where the product
should be visible.
